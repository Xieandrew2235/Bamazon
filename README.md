# Assignment: Bamazon
<hr>
<strong>Description: </strong> Bamazon was the main competition to Amazon back in the 70's, eventually succumbing to the power and brilliance of Amazon. Now, Bamazon survives only on 10 items, which can be purchased through our APP. Bamazon also does not have its own website, as the profit margins from the 10 items for sale don't quite allow for the maintenance of a full-on website.

## Instructions
<hr>

1. For this app, we will need two NPM packages. Navigate over to the Bamazon folder in your terminal, and type in your command line:

    * npm install mysql
    * npm install inquirer

2. You are then presented with a list of 10 items, along with its respective department, price, and quantity available. Immediately after, you will be prompted with a question asking for the ID number of the item you would like to purchase.

3. After choosing the item you would like to purchase, Bamazon then proceeds to ask how much quantity you would like to buy. Please be careful of the limited quantity available, as Bamazon does not ever restock. If you choose to proceed with a quantity greater than that available, you will be given an error message.

4. After completing your purchase, Bamazon will tell you the total cost of your purchase, and immediately prompt you again with the opportunity to buy more items.

# HAPPY SHOPPING!
